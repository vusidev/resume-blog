<h1>How to write a CV</h1><br>
<p>Things you should know before writing resume.</p><br>
<h2>Summary</h2><br>
<p>Best resume or bad resume does it play major role on getting a job?<br>answer is yes, resume is the face of a job hunter it do the talking before you talk.A resume is a document that recruiters use as a basis to decide who will be invited for an interview.The is a difference between a resume that ends up in a trash bin right away and the one that encourages a recruiter to meet a candidate.</p><br>

<h2>Should CV Be In Capitals?</h2><br>
<p>Don’t over-use capital letters.When writing a CV, the crucial thing is to be consistent with your style, so if you’ve used a lowercase letter for a job title in one place, use lowercase each time you mention the job.Never capitalise when it is incorrect to do so.</p><br>

<h2>Should Resume be in all caps?</h2><br>
<p>When you use all caps in your resume, it gives the impression that you’re yelling at the reader. Let your accomplishments stand for themselves.</p><br>

<h2>What tense should CV be in?</h2><br>
<p>If you’re employed and writing about the responsibilities and accomplishments in your present job, use the present tense. If you’re writing about a past job, use past tense.</p><br>

<h2>Is CV italicized?</h2><br>
<p>The term “curriculum vitae” does not need to be underlined or italicized, and the abbreviation “CV” does not require periods.</p><br>

<h2>Do you capitalize the name of a job position?</h2><br>
<p>I’m talking about job titles such as vice president, sales director, chairperson, mayor, and emperor. In general, titles that come before names are capitalized, and titles that come after names are lowercase.</p><br>

<h2>Is it OK to bold in resume?</h2><br>
<p>It’s OK to use some bolding and italicizing in your resume text. Many resume writers may bold their previous job titles and italicize subheadings within each section of the document. Multiple studies have shown that most readers find underlined text difficult o read.</p><br>

<h2>What words should be capitalized in a resume?</h2><br>
<p>When writing in bullet points, such as in a resume, capitalize the first word of each bullet point. Capitalize proper nouns – names of people, cities, places where you have specific references. If you worked at the White House, capitalize it.</p><br>

<h2>Should your name be centered on a resume?</h2><br>
<p>Your name should be at the very top and should stand out. You might make your name a bit larger in font than the rest of your resume, or bold your name, or both. You can center your contact information on the page, or make it left justified.</p><br>

<h2>Can my resume be 2 pages?</h2><br>
<p>Can a Resume Be 2 Pages? A resume can be two pages, but most should be one page. That’s true for entry-level candidates and those with less than 5 years’ experience. If the job requires Elon-Musk-level accomplishments, or you can’t cram your achievements on one page, write a two page resume.</p><br>

<h2>Should you bullet point your CV?</h2><br>
<p>Each bullet point should include a concise phrase or sentence that begins with an action word. You do not need to include a period at the end of each phrase. However, if you choose to use a period for one phrase, you have to use one for every bullet. It makes your resume look uniform.</p><br>

<h2>Is using capital letters rude?</h2><br>
<p>WRITING ENTIRELY IN BLOCK CAPITALS IS SHOUTING, and it’s rude. We’ve all done it: left the Caps Lock on while typing. But in email etiquette, online chats and or forum posts, writing in capitals is the online equivalent of shouting. It’s rude, so best not to do it unless you really do want to shout at someone.</p>
