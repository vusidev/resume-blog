<h2>Get Your Job Ready Resume</h2><br>
<p>How to make a perfect resume and land the dream job? Despite the fact that an average of 250 resumes are received for each job opening, choosing the right resume format can help you stand out from the competitive crowd.</p><br>

<p>A CV revamp is not extracting information on your old CV and put it on a new colorful template (mind your colors don't add any value) but it's restructuring content, making sure you include action verbs and use correct tenses for past and present roles. Be informed.A picture is really not important to put on a CV as it adds no value and in some instances it is not ATS Compliant and can be use to discriminate against facial appearance, age or race. Even if it's proper, some pictures put on a CV are not professional. Be informed.</p>

<p>Candidates are hired on value they bring to the other organization, so it is important to have an achievement section on your CV or rather make achievement based responsibilities as much as you can.</p>

<p>Any CV should have a professional summary which include what you're in terms of experience, skills and academics. Normally it should not have any pronouns. It however should be written in relation to acquired skills and competencies not just throwing words like motivated.</p>


<p>Have a good story to tell Make sure you have a captivating career-starting story that leaves no doubts that you are the perfect person for all kinds of jobs in a particular field. People will ask questions (so many questions!) so prepare clear and concise answers to why you want to enter this field, what you are going to do to reach this goal, and what you have to offer. This is where you impress with your passion, throw in all of the important skills and experiences, top it off with your education and persuade everyone you talk to.</p>

<p>Skills in a CV should be described in a clear way. Computer literacy, teamwork skills or creativity are all important, but they need to be appropriately presented. As far as possible, it is a good idea to link your skills with specific professional situations. And it doesn’t matter if you write about learned qualifications or abilities that result from your character.</p>

<p>Focus on the soft skills Transferable skills can be surprise transferred from one situation or job to another and show how you interact with people. Examples of these soft skills are interpersonal skills, organizational skills, leadership skills, and communication skills. Focus on your ability to motivate people, multitask, supervise, or speak in public. Create a CV that oozes personality and shows off your soft skills in all their employable glory.</p>

<p>Your resume is not so much about writing every little thing you have ever done, it's about highlighting what is relevant in your work history to your desired future opportunity.</p>


<p>Your accompanying cover letter should not exceed one page, there is no reason why it should. Its a high level overview of what is in your CV, it should make me want to open your CV (speak to your potential future employers needs and how you will meet them.</p>

<p>Revamp your CV And while we’re at it: make sure your CV reflects the key parts of this story. Focus on your talents and skills and not just on your job titles: create a CV that doesn’t dwell in the past, but looks ahead and showcases all the great things you can contribute to in the future.</p>
