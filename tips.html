<h1>14 Tips for better resume</h1>
<br>
<p>Every dream job starts with a resume screening and you should be able to show the recruiter that  you're smart.</p><br>
<p>1. Never start your CV with "Curriculum Vitae". Start with your name boldly written with a larger font.</p>
<br>
<p>2. Ensure the address on your CV is the same with the location of the job. It will make interviewers consider you faster. e.g, if the job is in Johannesburg, apply with a Joburg address. If you don't stay in the same location, look for someone you know that uses same location.</p>
<br>
<p>3. Don't use childish email address. Use an email address with your name. Don't use email address such as sexybecky4u2luv@gmail.com. It says a lot about your maturity and professionalism. You can use tshegokgokolo@gmail.com. If the name is already taken, add some numbers, e.g tshegokgokolo236@gmail.com.</p>
<br>
<p>4. Under personal data or profile. Some entities like date of birth, state and nationality are not compulsory. As a matter of fact, if the age they need doesn't favour you, just take off your date of birth. Keep the interviewer in doubt. Rather sell your skills.</p>
<br>
<p>5. Under educational background and dates, simply write your school, your course of study and then the year you graduated. Take off the year you got admission. Some people started school in 2005 and graduated in 2012 for a 4-year course. It might not be their fault but employers wouldn't take it that way since you're not there to defend it. So write out only graduation year.Also, there's no need for your grade (First class, 2.1, 2.2, etc). Just take it off.</p>
<br>
<p>6. Specific Certifications is another area that's making people lose out of job search in recent times. Under this section, most people don't have what to put and it pisses off most employers. It means you haven't done much to add value to yourself. If you are a fresh graduate try to do one or two short courses while at university like MS-EXCEL, SPSS, PASTEL, QUICKBOOKS Etc, else you will be submitting what we call a blank CV'. For those working, you can use your weekends to achieve same. It will help you in your next job search.</p>
<br>
<p>7. Under your work experience, you are expected to state where you worked, your job designation and your responsibilities. If you are no longer working in the firm, write your responsibilities in past tense. The current place of work can be written in present tense.</p>
<br>
<p>8.However, all your work experiences need not go on your CV except the one relates to the job you're applying for. it makes your CV concise.</p>
<br>
<p>9. Under your referees or references, please you are expected to have your referees name, address, phone number and email address. You can also use your family member as your referee but ensure you don't use the same surname. Also, ensure your referees are aware you are using them as referees.</p>
<br>
<p>10. An ideal CV should be in black and white not coloured except on two occasions: if you are applying as a graphic designer and you want to wow your employer or when your CV has the logo of the company you've worked before under your job experience.</p>
<br>
<p>11. Never forward a CV from your inbox to another employer. Open and compose a fresh mail then upload your CV and send.</p>
<br>
<p>12. When sending your CV, make sure the subject carries the job role you are applying for.</p>
<br>
<p>13. Don't save your CV on your laptop or phone as 'My CV' or Edited CV'. Simple save it with your full name, e.g Mavhungu Dakalo.</p>
<br>
<p>14. When sending your CV, don't leave the email page blank. Copy your cover letter and post on the email page. Forget the usual 'Sir, kindly find attached here with for your</p>
