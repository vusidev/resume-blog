<h1>Interview Tips</h1><br>
<p>1. Believe in yourself. Believe in God.</p><br>
<p>2. Stay cool, calm and confident.</p><br>
<p>3. Don't play with your expressions; keep a gentle smile on your face.</p><br>
<p>4. Take permission before entering the room (May I come in Sir?).</p><br>
<p>5. Your voice must be strong, clear and audible.</p><br>
<p>6. If the interviewer shakes hand with you, then it’s OK otherwise just say greetings Sir (Must).</p><br>
<p>7. Don’t shake hard very firmly/hardly; be well mannered in hand shake.</p><br>
<p>8. Don't sit on the chair unless he/she tells you to sit.</p><br>
<p>9. Don't stare at the roof and walls, keep focus on the interviewer.</p><br>
<p>10. Sit with your legs straight, don’t sit with cross legs.</p><br>
<p>11. Your back must be straight, don't sit in a relaxed manner.</p><br>
<p>12. Don't sit with both hands holding each other. Keep them apart.</p><br>
<p>13. You will be asked to introduce yourself, prepare your introduction.</p><br>
<p>14. Answer in the same language in which the question is asked.</p><br>
<p>15. If you are not sure about any answer, say "sorry Sir", avoid guessing.</p><br>
<p>16. Always give the close-most answer to every Math related question. Don't skip it.</p><br>
<p>17. Look into the eyes of the interviewer while answering to show your confidence.</p><br>
<p>18. Don't shake your head or move your hands while explaining.</p><br>
<p>19. Do not laugh if he tries to crack a joke. Just smile.</p><br>
<p>20. Personal questions will be asked, don't get angry, keep your cool and answer with logic.</p><br>
<p>21. Don't play with your dress, tie or shirt.</p><br>
<p>22. Show patriotism and determination.</p><br>
<p>23. First think, and then answer. Don't give the answer instantly because that will be considered a guess. Take your time even if you know the answer.</p><br>
<p>24. If you don't know the answer, still take your time, and say sorry. Don't say sorry instantly.</p>
