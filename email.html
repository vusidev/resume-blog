<h1>Tips for applying job via email</h1><br>
<p>In the world of work, quite often, you are what you write. This is nowhere more true than when submitting your resume and cover letter for consideration. Every impression counts. Your emailed message may be the very first thing a potential employer sees from you.</p><br>

<p>1. Use an effective subject line.</p><br>
<p>2. Address the hiring manager by name.</p><br>
<p>3. In the first paragraph, tell the hiring manager who you are and why are you contacting them.</p><br>
<p>4. In the second paragraph say what value you’d bring to the company.</p><br>
<p>5.Close the resume email body with saying you’re eager to meet in person.</p><br>
<p>6. Add a professional signature with your contact details.</p><br>
<p>7. Attach your resume and a cover letter saved in PDF with professional file names.</p><br>

<h2>Tired of ending up in the resume Black Hole?</h2><br>

<p>1. Get Documents Ready When you are sending cover letters and resumes as email attachments, the first step is to save your resume and letter in the right file format.Your documents should be sent as either a PDF or a Microsoft Document. If you have word processing software other than Microsoft Word save your resume as a Word (.doc or .docx) document. File, Save As, should be an option in whatever word processing program you use.To save your documents as a PDF, depending on your word processing software you may be able to File, Print to Adobe PDF or File, Save As, and choose the PDF option.If not, there are programs you can use to convert a file to a PDF. Saving documents as PDFs helps ensure that no formatting errors will appear if the person opening the documents has a different operating system from your own.Use your name as the file name, so the employer knows whose resume and cover letter it is, i.e., janedoeresume.doc and janedoecoverletter.doc.</p><br>
<p>2. Write an Email Cover Letter once you have saved your resume and cover letter and they are ready to send, the next step is to write an email cover letter to send with your documents.You can either write your cover letter directly in the email message or attach a copy of your cover letter.Either way, it's important to follow the directions in the job posting when emailing your cover letter, and resume or your application may not be considered.First, open your email account.Then click on Message at the top left of the screen or click on File, New, Message.You can either type your cover letter directly into the email message, copy and paste from a word processing document or if the company requests an attachment, send your cover letter with the email message.Be brief and to the point. Your email cover letter should not be any longer than two or three short paragraphs.</p><br>
<p>3. Include a Subject Line The Subject Line is one of the most important parts of the email messages you send to apply for jobs. Make sure your email message includes a Subject Line that explains to the reader who you are and what job you are applying for. Add a Subject to the email message before you start writing it. That way, you won't forget to include it afterward.</p><br>
<p>4. Add a Signature It is important to include an email signature with your contact information, so it's easy for the company to reach you. Include your full name, your email address, and your phone number in your email signature, so the hiring manager can see, at a glance, how to contact you.To add your signature to your email message, click on File, Insert, Signature if you have a signature saved that you use for job searching. If you haven't created an email signature, type your contact information (name, email address, phone) at the bottom of your message.</p><br>
<p>5. Attach a Resume and Cover Letter once your email message is ready to send, you will need to attach your resume and cover letter to your message.Click on Insert, Attach File. Microsoft Outlook will display a list of files in the default file folder of your computer. If your files are stored in a different folder, click on the appropriate folder.Click to select the file you want to add to your email message, click on Insert to attach the document to your email message. In Gmail, click the paperclip image to add your documents to the message.</p><br>
<p>6. Proofread and Send a Job Application Before you click send, be sure to proof read your email for grammar and spelling. Check to make sure that you have added a subject and your signature to the message.Then send a test message to yourself to be sure all the attachments come through, and your email message is perfect.Finally, send a copy of the message to yourself, as well as to the company, so you have a copy for your records. Add yourself as a Bcc (blind carbon copy) by clicking Bcc and adding your email address.Then click Send, and your cover letter and resume will be on the way to the employer.</p><br>
<p>7. Applying for Jobs Online In addition to applying for jobs via email, you will most likely also have to apply for jobs directly online. Many employers, especially large companies, use applicant tracking systems (also known as talent management systems) to track and manage job applications.</p><br>
